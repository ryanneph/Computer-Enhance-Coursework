Personal work produced while following Casey Muratori's ["Computer Enhance" course](https://www.computerenhance.com/).

Source code is primarily (if not completely) written using `Version: beta 0.1.047, built on 27 November 2022`
of Jonathan Blow's "jai" programming language on a modern Linux-based operating system. Access to the "jai"
compiler is currently (as of this writing) restricted to closed beta participants only. I will provide
best-effort to ensure the code remains as portable as possible, but support will not be guaranteed.

### Note about obtaining the course materials
Many example programs in this repository are intended to be executed with access to the original "Computer
Enhance" course materials. To facilitate this access, the `cmuratori-computer_enhance` directory is intended
to be an unmodified reproduction of the course materials.

Since these materials are not to be reproduced for non-subscribers of the course according to the "Computer
Enhance" license, they must be acquired separately. To ensure the examples within this repo can be executed
successfully, one should populate the `cmuratori-computer_enhance` directory with

```sh
git clone <computer-enhance-repo-url> cmuratori-computer_enhance
```
